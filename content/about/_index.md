Welcome to Citizen Labs, a place for innovation and citizen engagement focused on improving our community.

We work together with our community to use open data and open source technology to promote transparency, better understand problems, make better choices, and provide solutions that work.

We are developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help local and state governments, and civic organizations.
