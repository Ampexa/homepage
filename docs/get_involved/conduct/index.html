<h3 id="respect">Respect</h3>

<p>Citizen Labs is an intentionally positive community: that recognizes and celebrates creativity; collaboration of independent creators (and independence); and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that are a core strength of Citizen Labs.</p>

<p>Citizen Labs spaces are an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), physical appearance, or technology preferences.</p>

<p>We value respectful behavior above individual opinions. We expect all participants to behave respectfully and follow these rules in Citizen Labs’ activities, events, and digital forums.</p>

<p>Respectful behavior includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.</li>
<li>Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.</li>
<li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</li>
<li>Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy.</li>
<li>Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”</li>
<li>Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.</li>
<li>Strive to use and build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.</li>
<li>Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.</li>
<li>Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.</li>
<li>Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
<li>Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="harassment">Harassment</h3>

<p>Harassment includes intentional behavior which is found threatening or disturbing.</p>

<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination [related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, [your specific concern here].</li>
<li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
<li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>

<h3 id="resolve-peacefully">Resolve Peacefully</h3>

<p>We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.</p>

<p>If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.</p>

<p>If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please contact local law enforcement and/or remove yourself from the situation.</p>

<p>We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just strange. We will listen and work to resolve the matter. Use the form below to contact us.</p>

<h3 id="apologize-for-mistakes">Apologize for Mistakes</h3>

<p>Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Citizen Labs’ activities, events, and digital forums without warning or refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your participation.</p>

<p>As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can&rsquo;t foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers&rsquo; judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.</p>

<h3 id="anti-harassment-reporting">Anti-Harassment Reporting</h3>

<p>Please contact Citizen Labs about harassment, feel free to use the email template below. Include as much information as you would like.</p>

<p><code>I am writing because of harassment at a Citizen Labs event or space, (NAME, PLACE, DATE OF EVENT). You can reach me at (CONTACT INFO). Thank you.</code>
